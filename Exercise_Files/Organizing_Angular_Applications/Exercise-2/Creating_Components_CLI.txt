Directions:
In an Angular project on your local machine, use the CLI to:

1.) Create a movieDisplay component

2.) Create a flopVotes component with no tests and no separate template/styles
  - Ran into an issue when using the CLI for this task. The correct command is as follows: 
       ng g c flopVotes --skipTests --inlineTemplate --inlineStyle
       
3.) Create a basic rentalCart component by hand
  *Note: Type @Component and press enter in VS Code to easily add the correct import statement in rental-cart.component.ts

*** Questions to Consider ***
- What files are created?
- What files are modified?
- How does the decorator look?
- How does the class look?
