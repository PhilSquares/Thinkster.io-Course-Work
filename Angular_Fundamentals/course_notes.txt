Angular Fundamentals

*** Using the CLI ***
  - Start by intalling Angular CLI with the following command: 
       npm install @angular/cli -g

To create a new project, run: "ng new ProjectName"
  - There are a few optional parameters we can use here such as: 

       1.) --dryRun 
    This parameter will go through the entire process of creating an Angular project but won't make any changes to my file system. 
      - Shows the user what would happen without changing anything locally. 

       2.) --skipInstall
    Skips installing the node modules that take most of the time when creating a new project.

Once the new project is created, cd into it. For example "cd ProjectName"
  - To start the project, run "npm start"
