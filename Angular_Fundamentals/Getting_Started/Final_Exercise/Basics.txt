*** Final Exercise: Putting the Basics Together ***

1.) Create a new Angular application

2.) In the AppComponent
- Display the movie posters of 4 movie flops.
- Place a button for each one to vote for it.
- When a button is clicked, disable all of the buttons.
- Also, display a message next to the chosen poster that says "Chosen!"

3.) Bonus Challenge - Enable changing your vote
- Change the text of the clicked button to "Unvote" and don't disable it.
- If it is clicked again to "unvote" then re-enable the other buttons, remove the "Chosen!" message and change the button text back to "Vote" so that you can change your vote.
